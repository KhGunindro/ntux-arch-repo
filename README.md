## Overview

**ntux-arch-repo** is the official custom Arch Linux package repository for **NTUX OS**, a research- and development-oriented Linux distribution focused on modern workflows, clean design, and reproducible system builds.

This repository hosts **custom-built Arch packages** that are either:
* Not available in the official Arch repositories.
* Patched or customized specifically for NTUX OS.
* Built to support the NTUX installer, desktop environment, or internal tooling.

All packages follow **Arch Linux packaging standards** and are built using `makepkg` inside a clean Arch Linux build environment.
